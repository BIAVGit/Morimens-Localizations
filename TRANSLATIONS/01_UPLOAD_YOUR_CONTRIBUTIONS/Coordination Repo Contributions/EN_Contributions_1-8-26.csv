Item_122107_StoryDesc,bKVU,d道具_Item_A.csv,364,Item,StoryDesc,,新的一年，你决定举办一场前所未有的仪式，以最庄重的方式，迎接时间的更迭。\n为此，你筹备良久。点燃蜡烛，让温暖的光晕照亮冬夜的校园；在训练场中央搭起高台，铺上缀满花纹的深红绒毯。你甚至亲手裁出无数条金箔与银纱缠绕的彩带，只愿这倒数的时刻超越告别的怅然，化作岁末与新年相拥时永不褪色的印记。\n可是……还差些什么。\n你走进旧仓库深处，拂去层层尘埃，终于寻出那座古董时钟。它的外壳斑驳，指针早已在时光的侵蚀下断裂、脱落，显然不能使用了。\n就在一筹莫展之际，泰旖丝出现了，身后悄然立着一座崭新的时钟。\n那座时钟无比熟悉。她依旧轻佻地笑着，眼底却藏着某种温柔的笃定。\n「怎么样，这座时钟，配上我的舞蹈，一定是最盛大的仪式。」\n「这……不会是塔薇的时钟吧？」\n「哎呀，您也知道她孤零零地待在池水里，太沉闷了。」\n「这样让她加入我们的仪式，感受我的爱意，或许能让她有点兴致呢～」\n午夜悄然降临，泰旖丝立在巨大的时钟前，像被时间亲手包装的赠礼。\n彩带如未烬的烟花缠绕她的身躯，在流转的灯光下漾出金红与银蓝的波纹。腰际那只饱满的蝴蝶结，恰是新年亲手系上的最后一个绳扣——她就是岁末最盛大的献礼，裹着欢愉的绸缎，等待被时间拆封。\n她的手臂缓缓升起，指尖溯着光影游走，最终指向身后那枚悬垂的时钟。十二个数字在表盘上连成光晕，在她的指尖跃动。\n弥撒格的众人仰望着泰旖丝纵情的舞蹈，仿佛被欢愉的气氛感染，开始随着她的韵律一同荡漾。\n而当钟声落下，她指尖轻点，触向永恒的起始。那被捆缚的礼物张开双臂，将储存在岁末的所有欢庆化作漫天纷扬的祝福，洒向人间。,"In the new year, you decide to hold an unprecedented ceremony to solemnly welcome the passage of time.\nTo this end, you have been preparing for a long time. You light candles, letting their warm glow illuminate the winter night on campus; you set up a high platform in the center of the training ground, covered with a deep red velvet cloth adorned with intricate patterns. you even cut countless colorful ribbons wrapped in gold foil and silver gauze by hand, hoping that this countdown moment transcends the melancholy of farewell, transforming into an everlasting mark embraced by the year-end and the new year.\nBut... something is still missing.\nYou walk deep into the old warehouse, brushing away layers of dust, and finally find that antique clock. Its shell is worn, the hands have long since broken and fallen due to the erosion of time, and it is clearly unusable.\nJust when you are at your wits end, Thais appears, quietly standing behind a brand new clock.\nThat clock feels incredibly familiar. She still smiles playfully, but there is a certain gentle certainty hidden in her eyes.\n""What do you think? This clock, paired with my dance, will surely be the grandest ceremony.""\n""This... can't be Tavi's clock, can it?""\n""Oh, you know she has been all alone in the pool, it's too dull for her.""\n""Letting her join our ceremony and feel my love might spark her interest a bit~""\nMidnight quietly arrives, and Thais stands before the giant clock, like a gft wrapped by time itself.\nThe ribbons swirl around her body like unburned fireworks, creating golden-red and silver-blue ripples in the flowing light. The plump bow at her waist is the last knot tied by the new year—she is the grandest gift of the year-end, wrapped in joyful satin, waiting to be unsealed by time.\nHer arms slowly rise, her fingertips tracing the light and shadow, ultimately pointing to the hanging clock behind her. Twelve numbers connect in a halo on the clock face, dancing at her fingertips.\nThe congregation gazes at Thais's exuberant dance, seemingly infected by the joyous atmostphere, beginning to sway in rhythm with her.\nAnd as the chime falls, she lightly taps with her fingertip, touching the beginning of eternity. The bound gift opens its arms, transforming all the celebration stored at year-end into a shower of blessings that scatter across the world."
