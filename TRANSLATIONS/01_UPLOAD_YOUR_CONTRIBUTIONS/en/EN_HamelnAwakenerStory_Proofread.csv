His entire life revolved around a single thought, like a machine programmed with one command, devoid of all other responses.\nTo him, everything was merely a sequence of musical notes.\nPlay, play, endlessly play."

AwakerStory_60982_Content,atRj,h唤醒体故事_AwakerStory_A.csv,230,AwakerStory,Content,哈姆林,A.F. 31@1年@1月@2日，一位热爱音乐收藏的著名富豪被管家发现半夜暴毙于家中的书房，身上没有一丝伤口或中毒迹象，嘴角甚至还诡异地留有堪称满足的笑意。\n经警方勘察认定现场为密室条件，经历了无数刑侦高手和法医的检验，最终判定死者为意外猝死。\n然而这位正值壮年、身体康健甚至热爱马术运动的富豪为何在这样一个平平无奇的安静夜晚突然猝死，所有医生也给不出合理的理由。在其家属不满的威胁下，最终警方联系了审查会接管调查。\n原本只想息事宁人的审查会，竟然真的误打误撞从富豪书桌上散落的乐谱中检测出了灵知残留的痕迹。这份诡异的乐谱被送往弥萨格，据研究，这份残缺的乐谱来源自著名的《A小调安魂弥撒曲》遗失的后半篇章，然而乐谱的最后一页却依然并不完全，现场发现了许多笔迹狂乱的全新乐谱草稿，似乎是富豪在试图补全最后一页。\n在研究中发现，任何沉迷于乐谱的行为都会不同程度地导致癫狂，这份乐谱也很快被封存保管起来。经弥萨格学者推测，或许就是这项补全行为导致了富豪的疯狂与死亡，并以非常规的方式完成了唤醒仪式。\n之后很长一段时间校方都未搜索到任何这名未知唤醒体现身或伤人的线索，因而此事也逐渐被弥萨格的调查员们淡忘。\n只有音乐领域的学者们始终对那半份被封存的乐谱残篇念念不忘，一直期待着那传奇的安魂曲作者的出现。,"A.F. 31@1 Year @1 Month @2 Day, a famous tycoon who loved collecting music was found dead in his study by his butler late at night. There were no visible wounds or signs of poisoning on his body, and a strangely satisfied smile lingered on his lips.\nFollowing extensive examination by forensic experts, the death was ruled an accidental one, as the room was locked with no way to get inside.\nHowever, doctors could not provide a reasonable explanation for why this robust tycoon, who was in good health and even enjoyed horseback riding, suddenly died on such an ordinary and quiet night. Under pressure from his family, the police handed over the case to the Committee.\nInitially intending to quietly resolve the matter, the Committee unexpectedly detected traces of Gnosis on scattered sheet music found on the tycoon's desk. The eerie sheet music was sent to Mythag posthaste, where research identified it as fragments of the lost second half of the famous ""Requiem in A Minor."" The final page of the score remained incomplete, with numerous frantic drafts scattered around, seemingly attempts by the tycoon to complete it.\nScholars at Mythag speculated that this attempt to complete the score caused the tycoon's descent into madness and eventual death, completing the awakening ceremony in an unconventional manner and prompting its immediate sealing.\nFor a long time, Mythag found no evidence of this unknown Awakener appearing or causing harm, causing the case to gradually fade from investigators' minds and into obscurity.\nOnly scholars in the field of music continued to yearn for the sealed half-sheet, hoping for the legendary composer to emerge."

Even though he was willing to attend Mythag's musical events and guide the less adept students, most of the time, he played alone in a soundproof room or in secluded woods.\nExcept for official events, he called all of his playing simply ""practice,"" as if the practice was endless, and the perfect performance would never arrive.\n People praised his work, ""Such a diligent and humble master,"" they sung, intoxicated by its melody.\nYet, Hameln never knew humility; his words were always straightforward and overly harsh.\nSuch an obsessive pursuit of perfection in music made his classes a primary source of stress for students, earning him the title the ""devil's teacher.""\nIf, for some reason, you wished to get his attention, simply play the wrong note, and his frowning expression would be upon you almost immediately.\nHe bore no grudge against those he ""tormented,"" merely imposing his passionate, impossibly perfect standard upon them, even if it was much milder compared to what he demanded of himself.\nHe was like a horse with a carrot dangling overhead, forever striving for somethung unattainable.\nExcept for pausing for the elegant dancer, he rarely initiated contact with other Awakeners. However, he always displayed a surprising patience with requests and initiating conversation.\nPerhaps it wasn't indifference that hindered him, but too narrow a mind."

Hameln had never witnessed it in anyone around him during his long adolescence. It became a vague image—a symbol driving him forward under his father's whip.\nHe firmly believed that relentless diligence was the endless ladder to the perfection just out of reach. Even when he stood at the pinnacle of the world stage, it remained an unchanging truth.\nThis was until he met someone that could stand beside him.\n""What a dazzling genius!"" they cried: this gift of so-called talent was not within him, but another.\nFrom festering envy and jealousy, he suddenly felt an indescribable confusion and helplessness.\nWithout such talent, can I still reach the perfect end?\nThe rungs of the ladder of diligence had suddenly turned to ashes, while the door to perfection remained ever distant.\nHe often lingered outside the crowds that swarmed this genius, deliberately aloof.\nBut whenever he looked in that direction, he always silently rehearsed his greetings.\nThose mediocre insects always surrounded them, murmuring malicious whispers.\nHe was far too clumsy, silent for so long without being able to argue.\nWords meant little, he thought. Let music be his medium—for only music is the perfect language; surely they would understand.\nHowever, fate was a fickle beast, and would always come to reclaim the gifts it had so generously given.\nGeniuses die young, and yet the mediocre still stand.\nIn the past, provocations and scheming had never shaken him in the slightest.\nYet at this moment, looking at the stack of unsent, unsatisfactory music scores, he could only shed tears of anger.\nHameln suddenly understood: before reaching this perfect kingdom of heaven, he must use all means available in world below.\nFortunately, compared to those mediocre people, he already possessed the intellect to do it.\nAfter all, in his eyes, everything was nothing more than a calculation, like notes arranged on a score."
