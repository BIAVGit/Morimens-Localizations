His decree lingers at the edge of all dreams, divined by his all-encompassing authority. \nBefore the sun sets, the king is already weary. He is tired of his power, of his superhuman wisdom, of the fervent worship and offerings, and of those ancient, endless dreams.\nNo one knows what he dreams of during that long, endless slumber. Yet one thing is for certain, they should be grateful for the blissful ignorance."

Theosophists therefore proposed a hypothesis: the universe is an awe-inspiring cycle, and our world and humanity itself are but a brief link within it.\nToo many things silently dissolve in the cycle, leaving no trace for documentation. There is thankfully, an upside, as some forces are so ancient and extreme that even mere remnants of their presence can produce immeasurable impacts on our era.\n—For instance, the crew of the seafaring vessel ""Vigil"" unexpectedly discovered something deep at the bottom of the Southern Ocean, at least expanding humanity's understanding of prehistoric civilizations back tens of thousands of years.\nFrom this, we learned of an ancient civilization that had nations, kings, and unique belief systems, which perished in a great flood that swallowed the entire world, now long sleeping beneath the ocean.\nHad it not been for the assistance of the Mystia Treaty Committee in the blockade efforts of censoring information, human history might have been rewritten— today's world is still not ready to face such an upheaval.

Researchers closely observe and publish papers about him often, and the Archaeology and Astronomy departments frequently extend invitations to him for academic discussions.\nTulu holds considerable influence among Awakeners: Murphy becomes gloomy at the mere sight of him, Goliath appears to become jealous and competitive, and Miryam regards his every word as gospel truth.\nHe shows no particular attitude toward these matters, neither expecting nor demanding anything in particular.\nSometimes he responds to requests according to his whims, and sometimes he does not."

All he had to do was move with the flow of the current, fulfill his role, and be a one-of-a-kind ""messenger"" to the people.\nYet, Tulu harbored an unspoken prophecy: this great nation would be eventually destroyed by a great flood, and civilization would ultimately be buried beneath the ocean waves.\nBeing the mouthpiece of Gods had made him all too aware of the inevitability of this destruction—yet at least in the final moments, he hoped for his people to not live in fear and uncertainty.\nThis was his final decree, not merely as a ""proxy of the divine"", but as a King."

Other times, he even ventures deep into these dreams to confront these Gods...\nHe has never sought revelations or prophecies from them, yet no matter how he tries to escape, they always, inevitably, become a reality.\nHe has never asked offerings of any kind; others fear and worship him without his concern.\nRebirth is but an interruption of his eternal slumber.\nNo need to call his name, no need to pray."
