His silhouette aweing, his power indestructible. His weapon, a colossal blade that no one else can lift. His victories, gleaming like oiled fur on the blade's fang, nourished by countless wars and savage  sacrifices. His trophies, a mountain of heads severed from his enemies and kins, crowned by his own on the top."

AwakerStory_11369_Content,atQn,h唤醒体故事_AwakerStory_A.csv,75,AwakerStory,Content,戈利亚,A.F.3@2年4月2日，阿什杜德地区一处庙宇遗迹遭到了破坏。\n作为唯一读过大学的人，我这个游客被地区长官邀请参与了对遗迹的建筑学评估。哈哈，千万不能让他们知道我的「大学」其实并不是那么一回事。\n3日下午，我进入了庙宇的中心，古代闪族人将这座庙宇作为祭祀场所，这里曾盛行着某种已失传的异教信仰。\n然而出现在我面前的，是所有人都不会认错的一座雕塑。我清楚地知道，那具雕塑上的褶皱，原本该是斜纹亚麻布的纹理。\n雕像双手折断、身首分离，下肢被摔碎在门槛上，浑身像被蛞蝓爬过似的沾满黏液。我注意到了几道奇特的抓痕，和一个巨型的、有蹼的足印。\n异教信仰也许仍在该地区流传，但暂无需要展开正式调查的必要性，我会延长在阿什杜德地区的停留时间。\n――芬@1・@2森《非利士五城遗址巡礼》,"On April 2, A.F.3@2, a temple remain in the Ashdod region was vandalized.\nAs the only one who had university education, I, a mere visitor, was invited by the regional administrator to participate in the architectural assessment of the ruins. Haha, I should never let them know that my ""university"" isn't quite what it seems.\nOn the afternoon of April 3, I entered the center of the temple. Ancient Semitics used it as a place of worship, and their pagan belief once flourished among the pillars before lost in history.\nYet what appeared before me was a sculpture that could be mistaken by no one. I clearly knew that the folds on its clothes should indicate the texture of striped linen.\nHowever, its both hands were broken, its head severed from the body, and its lower limbs shattered on the threshold. Mucilage covered everywhere like the trace of a sticky slug. Upon inspection, there were few peculiar scratches buried within, accompanied by a giant, webbed footprint.\nThe pagan belief may still circulate nearby, but a formal investigation is not urgently necessary. I will extend my stay in the Ashdod region.\n―Fin@1・@2sen, ""An account of a trip around five cities of the Philistines"""

According to Miss Erica's battle records, his brutal brawn can no doubt gurantee his advantage even in isolated and vicious situations. I believe that Goliath does not care about the level of his partner's ability just because no one can hold a candle to him in his world.\nHowever, everytime Goliath faces Miryam, fear always seeps from his eyes uncontrollably. It's hard to imagine what kind of existence would evoke such awe from this despotic ruler and brutal former-king.\nAdditionally, he has shown unusual concern for Miss Murphy. Sometimes he was witnessed to wander around the university's surrounding maze, maybe waiting for Murphy to return from her mission. Sometimes he would distantly observe Murphy's condition, seemingly worrying about possible injuries during her tasks.\nMiss Peaslee also notices this. Once she said to me half-jokingly, ""Hey, don't you think he's trying to be an ordinary father?""\n―""Observation record from an intern researcher"""

A declaration of death for his people, while a coronation of majestic power for him.\nWhen exile marks his failure, bitterness drown his breath; when despration hollows for surrender, and tides clamor for sacrifice―he prays to the God for the power. His transcendent power.\nThus the God's apostle accepts his prayer, severing his head as an offering.\nThus the God's apostle acknowledges his prayer, emplacing the remnants of immortal on his exposed cervical spine.\nThus the God's apostle answers his prayer, leading him into the sanctum of eternity."

The glitter on his blade fades. The mask of apostle conceals his savage expression.\nHe did revere instinctively when that miracle manifested. But no god could capture his fear, and no cult could earn his faith.\nA giant should not yield to others. A warrior should not lower his head.\nHis past already wreathed in dust, his war still longing for final triumph. The desire for conquest run through his veins, etching into bones like a sigil bearing the bestowed power. Perhaps, one day, death will end his dominion. Perhaps, one day, he will rise to the sole supremacy."
