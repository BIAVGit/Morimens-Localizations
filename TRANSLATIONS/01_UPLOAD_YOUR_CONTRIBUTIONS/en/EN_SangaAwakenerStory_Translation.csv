She only pursues the absolute form of purified beauty, which etching the ephemeral moments into eternity.\nAs her inspiration surging forth, her chisel never ceases; as her works witnessing completion, her body submerges in coral-colored shades. In the corner of her workshop which she pays no heed, her agony and delight intertwine, sprouting from her very existence.",,,,,,,

The assailant shouted while hammering at the sculptor August's final work, ""The Nameless Ms. Coral"", before hastily stopped by the congregation. However, this unstrung old man had surprisingly turned out to be none other than the long-reclusive August himself.\nFor a time, speculations and discussions about ""The Nameless Ms. Coral"" flooded in.\nSome people said it was inspired by a female apprentice named Sanga, who was the actual owner of August's best works. August is merely a shameful plagiarist.\nSome people said that Sanga came from an illustrious family―her father was a renowned writer, and her brother was a diplomat. In order to pursue the sculpture art, she disengaged with her family and set alone to Paris, living penuriously until her death.\nSome people said Sanga suffered from a strange illness. Ominous black ooze streamed on her body, and her each carving transformed a part of her flesh into coral. ""The Nameless Ms. Coral"" was actually her coraled appearance, not a sculpture at all.\nOther people said...\nThe apprentice, the devoted, the patient. Words pile upon Ms. Coral, sculpting her as the crowd dispersed from the exhibition hall. She blinks in the pouring moonlight. She's still waiting, and waiting―for her moment of returning home.",,,,,,,
