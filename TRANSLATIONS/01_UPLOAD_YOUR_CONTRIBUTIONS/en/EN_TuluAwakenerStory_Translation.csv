Prophecies awake from His unfathomable dreams. Territories flourish in His sovereignity.\nWeariness casts its texture on His crown ere the sunset. Exhaustion weaves in twilight: of His own authority, of the transcedent wisdom, of fervent worshipping and sacrifices from believers, and of the dreams drowning from ancient aeons.\nNo one exactly knows what stirs in His endless slumber, yet they should be grateful for being enclosed in such placid ignorance."

Facing with the vast, black seas of infinity, people won't stop to voyage far into the unknown.\nPerhaps this is not the first time we are warned about the lurking danger, ot hinted at the dread truth. Theosophists have guessed at the awesome grandeur of the cosmic cycle wherein our world and human race form transient incidents.\nMany has dissolved in distant cycles, leaving no trace for further verification―which should still be regarded as a mercy, since among those old and unhallowed cycles some ancient supreme force still echoing, which may be conceivably the survival of a hugely remote period, threating to cast immeasurable shadows on our era.\n―For instance, the unexpected discovery of the ""Vigilant"" from the bottom of the Southern Ocean has dramatically advancing humanity's understanding of prehistoric civilizations for at least ten thousand years.\nWe therefore can get a glimpse on an ancient civilization with national systems, monarchs, religious beliefs, and its fall to the undersea depth during a global flood.\nHad it not been for the assistance of the Mystia Treaty Committee in the blockade efforts, human history might have been rewritten―and today's world is still not ready to face such upheaval."

His openly insouciant towards the current world is unprecedented.\nHis abilities are outstanding. Perhaps he could even foresee all the turbulences and theats in our world. But he choose to spend most of his time in the haze of dreams.\nThough unintentionally on doing so, he has become well-known across the university. Researchers observe his most minor moves and turn them into papers; the Archaeology and Astronomy departments frequently extend invitations for academic discussions, specifically requesting his attendance.\nTulu maintains his considerable influence among Awakeners: his presence makes Murphy gloomy upon sight, his power evokes Goliath's inexplicit competitive desire all the time, and his words are put onto Miryam's shrine.\nHowever those reactions fall into blandness on his face, which is flat and unemotional like the tranquil sea. No demands. No expectations.\nSometimes their requests earn his responds as he wishes to. Other times they just dissolve into the slumbering air enclosing him."

His position is nothing more than a ""messenger"". Drifting in their tides. Preparing for their arrangement.\nHowever, there is one prophecy Tulu left untold: the nation would be drown by flood. The civilization would sink beneath the waves.\nForeseen by his omniscient power, the final destruction is inevitable―But trepidation and skeptism can still be imprisoned in his dream. His people can live soundly until the last moment.\nThis is His determination, not as a ""proxy of the divine"", but as a king."

Nevertheless, he remains somnolent when awake.\nIn the realm of dreams, there are furies from the existences he can't speculate, there are intertwining space-time with eldritch contradictions; there are even abysms gaping from loathsome depth, where the God itself dwells within...\nHe never seeks revelations from that very existence, yet prophecies still rise with indisputable clarity and accuracy.\nHe never asks for any worship, yet he still enshrined, involuntarily and indifferently, in their pious eyes.\nHis reborn is but an interruption of aeon-long slumber.\nNo need to call, no need to pray."
