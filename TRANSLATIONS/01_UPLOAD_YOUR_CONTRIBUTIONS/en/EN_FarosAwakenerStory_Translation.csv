Never show curiouity about the maybe different appearance beneath her malformed hemlet; never forget her long-lasting dissatisfaction with that humanoid body.\nHer gleaming light once lured moths to the molten warmth. Her burning fire once guided the lost to their doom. But now, only confusion flickers in her lighthouse, overlooking the disorienting sea."

When the reinforcements finally found the spearhead ship, it had already lost power, drifting by the current towards the center of the Monge Triangle. All crew members were severely dehydrated and feeble. Massive hallucinations with acute intensity have been reported.\nDuring the medical examination of the crew, a Silvercore was found among Investigator Ivors' personal belongings. The investigator himself consistently denied any contact between the ship and any Awakener.\nThe Silvercore was later sealed by the Awakener Department, numbered 6291-S-S-01, scheduled to use as teaching materials for pre-investigators in A.F. 315."

Her words only illuminates when confusion stirs the air, while her guidances clearer than nautical navigation.\nOnly when she meets with other Aequor visitors does the light reveal her shadow, twisting under paranoid madness.\nIn contrast to her serene and intellectual appearance, Faros has unexpectedly profound knowledge in ocean voyages. Despite the unresolved suspicions of abducting and sacrificing sailors, she has assisted the university in revising numerous nautical documents under the Keeper's supervision.\n―According to feedback from sailors of cooperative vessels, Faros's revisions, though effective, often (though not clear whether she is intentionally or not) steer the course towards the Monge Triangle.\nThe university has then prohibited Faros from accessing any ocean-related materials."

A glorious ascension for the most devout follower of her true lord. A golden promise for the most loyal subject of her king.\nIt collapses. The Divine Realm is a sinking lie, a fortress without foundation, a vine drifting away from its soil. Her dolor billows. Her desolation turmoils. The remaining faith in the Divine Realm cannot keeps Faros afloat anymore. The poor wanderer eventually drowned.\nDiving deep into the sea, her love and hatred agitates into swelling waves. The water whirls and spumes and eddies, splendor as the ceremony fireworks in her memory, a festival almost like a solace.\nHer final torched gaze before being beheaded by the hero, must have been cling to the Divine Realm she couldn't forgo."

Even her body has altered to an Awakener, tides of her homeland still clamor in her soul.\nThe breath of sea-bottom volcanoes dissipated from her ears. The ocean's dreams writhing with ecstasies obscured from her eyes. Only her obsession with the Divine Realm still gleaming, more glorious than ever.\nMind her docility, a mere temporarily disguise. Her king's throne calls to her, like a lighthouse reaches through the aeons; her sacrifice will always be everything, like a wick's devotion to the light."
